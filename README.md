# Student Management System - Spring

A CRUD app with basic functionality showing how to integrate Springboot (Backend) with Thymeleaf template engine and Bootstrap (Frontend).

## Installation

To run the app:
- Setup a database. I was using PostgreSQL, if you want to use another DBMS, make sure to update the JDBC dependency in `pom.xml`.
- Change the fake data in `application.properties` with yours.
- Complete maven build processes and run the app.
- Check `Controller` class for available routes.
